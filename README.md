## Structs 

You can think of structs as objects if your background is JS.

Structs can be embeded into another.

### Notes

Go is passed by value.

Slices and structs work different with pointers and modified value/references

slice are fancy arrays

|slice|array|
|---------|---------------------- |         
|tr to head    |has the actual values|
|capacity       |   |
|length         |   | 

even if the slice is being copied it is still pointing to
the array.

other types that fuction the same (reference types):
maps, channels, pointers, functions
