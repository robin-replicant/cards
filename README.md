## Maps

- the values must be the same type.
- the keys must be the same type.

### Differences between structs and maps

*Map*
- All keys must be the same type.
- All values must be the sae type.
- Keys are indexed, we can iterate over them.
- Reference type!
- Use to represent a collection of related properties.
- Don't need to know all the keys at compile time.

*Struct*
- Values can ve of different type.
- You need to know all the different fields at compile time.
- Keys don't support indexing.
- Use to represent a "thing" with a lot of different properties.
- Value type!
